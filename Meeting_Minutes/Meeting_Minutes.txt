Consolidated Meeting minutes  – Project Planning
Date: 12 october 2025 to till date

Attendees: Amil Thomas, Ranjith Radhakrishnan, Sachumon Puthenpuraickkal Sajeev

Agenda:

•	Finalization of project title and problem statement 
•	Identification of key objectives and expected outcomes 
•	Discussion on urban running challenges and pollution impact 
•	Selection of data sources (GIS, AQI APIs, OpenStreetMap) 
•	Choice of technology stack (Python, Streamlit, ML libraries) 
•	Machine learning model selection and justification 
•	Routing and graph-based pathfinding approach discussion 
•	Task distribution among team members 
•	Timeline planning and milestone definition 
•	Risk identification and mitigation strategies 
•	Documentation and portfolio structure planning 
•	Agreement on evaluation criteria and success metrics

Decisions:

•	The project will focus on optimizing jogging routes by combining distance, environmental safety, and route quality.
•	The application will be developed as a web-based system using Streamlit.
•	Google Maps APIs will be used for geocoding and location services.
•	Google Air Quality API will be integrated for real-time AQI data.
•	OpenStreetMap data via OSMnx will be used for graph-based routing.
•	A Random Forest Regressor will be used to score jogging path segments.
•	Loop-based route generation will be implemented to meet target distances.
•	Plotly will be used for interactive maps and pollution visualization.
•	GitHub will serve as the public repository for the project portfolio.

Action Items:

•	Ranjith: Design and implement the core backend logic, including route generation, graph construction using OSMnx, and integration of AQI data.
•	Ranjith: Develop and train the Random Forest machine learning model for scoring jogging path segments.
•	Amil Thomas: Collect, preprocess, and document geographic and air quality data used in the application.
•	Amil Thomas: Create pollution heatmaps and assist with visualization of environmental data.
•	Sachumon Puthenpuraickkal Sajeev: Design the Streamlit-based user interface and implement user input handling and layout styling.
•	Sachumon Puthenpuraickkal Sajeev: Assist with testing the application and improving usability based on feedback.
•	Entire Team: Prepare meeting minutes, maintain process documentation, and update the GitHub project portfolio regularly.
•	Entire Team: Prepare interim presentations, collect feedback, and incorporate suggested improvements into the project.
